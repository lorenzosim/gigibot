# Gigibot

A simple UCI chess engine written in Swift. I created it as a hobby project and to try out Swift for the first time.
The engine is not particularly strong, it wins about half the games against Stockfish set to skill level 2 (tested in 2+1 blitz).

## Compiling

Tested on Mac an Linux, but should compile on Windows as well.
*  Install [Swift](https://swift.org/)
* run `swift build --configuration release`.

## Running

Download an UCI-compliant UI (Cute Chess, Jerry, Arena, etc.) and add it as an engine.
