# Gigibot

A very simple UCI chess engine written in Swift. The engine is not particularly strong, but can be challenging for
beginners (beats Stockfish at skill level 1).

## Compiling

Install [Swift](https://swift.org/) and run `swift build --configuration release`.

## Running

Download an UCI-compliant UI (Cute Chess, Jerry, Arena, etc.) and add it as an engine.
